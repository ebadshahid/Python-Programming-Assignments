    "Object-oriented programming, also known as OOP or OO programming, is a programming language paradigm. In an object-oriented program, the code can be structured as reusable components, some of which may share properties or behaviors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inheritance - Eliminate redundant code by inheriting functions and data from other classes.\n",

    "# Define the following terms:\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a template or blueprint that is used to create objects.\n",
    "Class representation of objects and the sets of operations that can be applied to such objects.\n",
    "A class consists of Data members and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world an entity that has state and its behavior is known as an object.\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Car is an object. It has states (name, color, model) and its behavior (changing gear, applying brakes).\n",
    "A Pen is an object. Its name is Parker; color is silver etc. known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.\n",
    "In real-world object and software object have conceptually similar characteristics. In terms of object-oriented programming, software objects also have a state and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are the individual things that differentiate one object from another and determine the appearance, state, or other qualities of that object. Let's create a theoretical class called Motorcycle. A motorcycle class might include the following attributes and have these typical values:\n",

    "Color: red, green, silver, brown\n",
    "Style: cruiser, sport bike, standard\n",
    "Make: Honda, BMW, Bultaco\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them. For example, to go back to the theoretical Motorcycle class, here are some behaviors that the Motorcycle class might have:\n",
